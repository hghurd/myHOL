[*] Update logos/links
      - Not going to Tech anymore, maybe remove Tech logos and links
      - Find a HFC logo for the page's banner (?)

[*] Update weather widget
      - Find out where you found the code
      - Change location to either Wyandotte or Dearborn

[*] Stop using two logos in the banner (?)

[*] Implement dynamic resizing
      - Read a bunch of shizz on W3Schools, prolly?

[*] Import deadlines/events from Canvas/Moodle/Google Calendar
      - Import date(s), time(s) and assignment names
      - Make a new container for a to-do widget
      - Maybe a different container for upcoming events (NOT ASSIGNMENTS)
      - Style it accordingly

      - Put links in their own respective containers
          --I.E.: A school links 'widget' and a personal links 'widget'
      - Use more width of the page

[*] Use a new style (?)
      - Different CSS?
      - Completely different configuration?
